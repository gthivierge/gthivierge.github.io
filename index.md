<div class="about-text" markdown="1">

I am a 5th year PhD candidate in the department of statistis and data science at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by Will Townes and am part of the [Delphi group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/). I plan to graduate in May 2026 and am currently seeking industry positions. I have previous experience in both the pharmaceutical industry and fixed income investments, and am always excited to learn new subject matter through the lens of statistics.
