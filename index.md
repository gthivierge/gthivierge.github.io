I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University, planning to graduate around May 2026. I am advised by [F. William Townes](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/research/members/will-townes.html).

I am a member of the [Delphi Research Group](https://delphi.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon, which focuses on infectious disease tracking and forecasting. As part of my work with Delphi, [I have worked on](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2025.100820) incorporating spatial information into influenza-like illness forecasting with autoregressive models, and now work on Bayesian hierarchical modeling for delay distributions of infectious disease reporting. I have included further details about my research on the research tab.
