  ## Gabrielle Thivierge

I am a 5th year PhD candidate in the department of statistis and data science at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by Will Townes and am part of the Delphi group. I plan to graduate in May 2026 and am currently seeking industry positions. I have previous experience in both the pharmaceutical industry and fixed income investments, and am always open to learning new subject matter through the lens of statistics.
